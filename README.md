# InitGL

## Overview
### Why another guide?
There are some great resources available online on the basics of graphics programming with OpenGL. Unfortunately, most of them assume that the reader already has all the necessary libraries and software set up beforehand. For those not familiarized with the process of setting up a portable C++ project, it can be quite confusing. I decided to create this guide in order address that issue. By the time you reach the end, you should have everything you need to successfully get started with other OpenGL tutorials.

### What this guide covers
This guide will explain how to create a portable project structure (using CMake), integrate some libraries (GLFW and glad), and build / run a simple OpenGL application.

### Prerequisites
In order to follow this guide, you will need to know the basics of your build system (how to compile / run code). The guide is compatible with any build system that CMake supports (examples include Visual Studio, Xcode, and Makefiles).
